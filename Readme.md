## Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

# Kickstarter Analysis



## Project Overview

This project aims to find out how the different Kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to both their launch dates and the goals that were set for the campaign.




## Analysis and Challenges

This Section discusses the outcomes of the analysis carried out based on the date the fundraising was launched and the goals that were set for each of the fundraising events.
The Launch date was filtered on the Parent category "theater" while the outcome based on goals was filtered on the subcategory "plays".

### Analysis of the outcome based on the Launch Date

The parent category theater has subcategories which include:
* plays

* musicals

* spaces

There were 1369 theater fundraising campaigns out of which 839 were successful, 493 campaigns failed and 37 of them got canceled. Below is an image that shows the theater outcomes based on the launch dates.

From the image, the following observations can be made:
* A lot of successful campaigns started in the months of May and June
* October was a bad month to start a campaign even though the amount of successful campaigns was higher than the failed campaigns.


### Analysis of the outcome based on the Goal

This was just based on the the subcategory plays and and below is the diagram of the analysis.
